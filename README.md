# Killingsworth Kid Blog

## Installation

No installation is necessary. If you were to try to run this locally after having downloaded the repo you would run into permissions issues with google's api. 

The deployed app is available [here](https://katiekillingsworthbabyblog.netlify.app/blog)

## Usage

# Home page
The home page will have links to registries coming soon.

# Poll
The google form is embedded with an iframe and requires a google sign in to complete and can only be filled out once per google account.

# Blog
The Blog utilizes a custom API built by myself (see the repo [here](https://github.com/killingsworth-kristen/killingsworth-kid-backend).) I used google's Oauth2.0 for user verification. Admin accounts have access to add/edit/delete posts, as well as edit and delete comments for any user not just their own. Every user, including admin, can like/unlike posts, add comments, and edit/delete comments that they originiated.
